# LLM-Project

This project was created for the course Synthesizing Digital Efforts to Deliver Better Outcomes (IS883) while studying at Questrom School of Business at Boston University. 

The code was authored by Willem Seethaler, Chris Tash, Matt Nathin, Yelim Woo, and Natchaya Udompanich who are all dual degree candidates MBA + MS '24.

Willem Seethaler was the lead engineer for the project. 

The team identified an existing problem in the accounting industry, Senior employees in public accounting must spend a material amount of time answering important but predictable questions from junior staff. Many questions are not broad enough to be fully answered by a standard web query because they must be applied to a certain client or specific event. As a result, junior staff must ask their supervisor for assistance, requiring a significant amount of time to be set aside for both individuals.

By taking a design thinking approach, we first asked some accountants if they currently use ChatGPT to solve this issue. We found that many do use ChatGPT, and one firm even deployed a pre-trained model of ChatGPT 3.5 internally so staff and seniors could use it without the firm having to be concerned about confidentiality issues that could stem from using OpenAI's public instance. Despite actions like this taken to minimize confidentiality risks, we noticed a significant overall level of distrust in the software among many accountants. How could they trust an output from ChatGPT when popular media and OpenAI themselves cautioned ChatGPT’s use? How can they ensure they’re getting the most accurate responses every time?

Our response to this concern was a fine-tuned, prompt-engineered instance of ChatGPT 4-turbo supporting a lightweight front-end UI with similar functionality but more control over verbosity and business need. Please feel free to explore the project and reach out as we would be happy to discuss anything further.
